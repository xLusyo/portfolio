We built the Midwest Legacy Fence & Deck website as a fully custom WordPress project for a fence and construction business, focusing on a clean layout, strong branding, and clear service presentation. The goal was to create a modern, trustworthy online presence that helps homeowners easily understand the company’s offerings and reach out for estimates. The design highlights completed projects, service categories, and strong calls-to-action to support lead generation.

From a technical standpoint, the site is built on a custom WordPress theme with optimized performance, and flexible content structures that allow the client to update images, services, and featured projects without relying on additional plugins. I also ensured fast loading times, responsive layouts, and SEO-friendly markup to improve visibility and user experience. The result is a solid, easy-to-manage website that effectively represents the brand and supports the business’s growth.
