The Digital Feet Portal is a full stack web application built using Laravel, Livewire, and Tailwind CSS, designed to centralize client interactions and project workflows. I developed core modules for service ordering, asset uploads, messaging, and progress tracking, ensuring a seamless experience across both the client and internal team dashboards. The platform was architected with reusable components, optimized Eloquent queries, and a modular structure to support scalability and future feature expansion.

On the integration side, I implemented connections with HubSpot CRM & CMS, Dynamics for Marketing, Power Automate, and Zapier to automate onboarding, notifications, and project data syncing. I also worked with REST APIs, custom authentication flows, and role-based access controls to maintain security and data consistency across systems. The result is a performant and maintainable internal platform that significantly reduces manual operations and improves communication efficiency for the entire workflow.
