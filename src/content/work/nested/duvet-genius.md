The Pemble Painting website is a fully custom WordPress build I completed in September 2025. Designed from the ground up, the project focused on creating a modern, professional online presence that reflects the client’s brand and services. I developed a custom theme tailored to their visual identity, ensuring a clean layout, responsive design, and smooth user experience across all devices.

The entire build took three weeks, during which I implemented custom sections for services, past projects, and lead inquiries to support the client’s business goals. By integrating flexible backend controls and clean code structure, the client can easily manage content without relying on complex plugins. The result is a fast, lightweight, and visually polished website that strengthens the client’s credibility and improves customer engagement.
